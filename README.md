# (WIP) The card game Spit recreated to be online multiplayer with PyGame

# How to play:
  Spit is a 2-player, reflex-based game.
  It is sort of similar to a multiplayer Solitaire.
  Each player has 5 piles of cards in front of them.
  Each player also has a stack of auxillary cards that they draw from to form the 2 decks at the center in the start of the round.
  The goal of the game is to place the cards in your piles on the 2 center piles in ascending/descending order (suit does not matter).
  If you uncover a face-down card, you can flip that card face-up to make it availible for play.
  You can stack multiple cards of the same number/face on top of eachother in your piles.
  If you play all the cards from a pile, you may place another card face-up in that location.
  When you and your opponent run out of cards, both draw a card from their auxilary decks and places it on the center piles, respectively.
  When you run out of cards in your piless, slap the smaller center deck. This is then added to your auxilary deck, which you create new piles from for the next round.
