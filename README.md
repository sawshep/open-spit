Controls:
  The Left and Right arrows select the actual hand you want to use to pick up the cards. You must hold down a hand button before making any action.

  The Up and Down arrow correspond to the far stack and the near stack.

  A, S, D, F, and Spacebar correspond to piles in your hand.

  G is the flip button.

  Hold down Left or Right and select ASDF or Space to pick up a card. Doing the same with a card already in your hand will place it back down.

  You can only flip cards if the rules allow you to.
